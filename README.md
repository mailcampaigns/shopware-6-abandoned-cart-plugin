![Plugin Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mailcampaigns/shopware-6-abandoned-cart-plugin)
![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mailcampaigns/shopware-6-abandoned-cart-plugin)

This [Shopware 6](https://www.shopware.com/en/products/shopware-6/) plugin adds an `/abandoned-cart` API endpoint that allows you to retrieve shopping carts that your customers have left behind.
> **ℹ️ Note:** By default, Shopware stores shopping carts in the SQL database. For high-throughput scenarios, Shopware supports storing carts in Redis instead of SQL. If your Shopware installation is configured to use Redis for cart storage, this plugin may not be compatible, as it expects carts to be stored in the database. Learn more: [Shopware Cart Storage](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/hosting/performance/cart-storage.html)

After a configured number of **seconds**, a cart can be considered abandoned.  
It only returns carts of **active known customers** that have **not been converted to an order** yet.

Use this data to send automated cart recovery reminders to increase your conversions.

## 🔧 Configuration

After activating, configure the cart timeout setting:

Make sure this timeout is **less than** than Shopware's own cart expiration setting:

- `abandoned_cart:delete` permission to **delete** abandoned carts

> 🧠 Abandoned carts are generated using [scheduled tasks] and depend on the [message queue].
