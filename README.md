This [Shopware 6](https://www.shopware.com/en/products/shopware-6/) plugin adds an `/abandoned-cart` API endpoint that allows you to retrieve shopping carts that your customers have left behind.

After a configured number of **seconds**, a cart can be considered abandoned.  
It only returns carts of **active known customers** that have **not been converted to an order** yet.

Use this data to send automated cart recovery reminders to increase your conversions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can either upload the `.zip` manually or install via Composer.

### 🔌 Composer Installation

```bash
composer require mailcampaigns/shopware-6-abandoned-cart-plugin
bin/console plugin:refresh
```

### 🔄 Activate Plugin

**Option 1 (Admin panel):**  
Go to `Extensions > My extensions` and activate the plugin.

**Option 2 (CLI):**

bin/console plugin:install --activate MailCampaignsAbandonedCart
bin/console cache:clear
```

## 🔧 Configuration

After activating, configure the cart timeout setting:  
> "Number of seconds after which a cart is considered abandoned" (default: `3600`)

Make sure this timeout is **shorter** than Shopware's own cart expiration setting:  
> `Time in minutes for a customer to finalize a transaction`

> 🧠 Abandoned carts are generated using [scheduled tasks] and depend on the [message queue].
